					Eris has Ruijerd read her the details of each of the jobs and said something rather dangerous.
<br><br>
					It’s good when Ruijerd takes care of things.
<br><br>
					“Heyhey, pukuku, everybody of de…dead end…ha… That is… fufu, just a bit, kuku, high of a rank for you isn’t it?”
<br><br>
					And then the guy who has been grinning at us for a while approached the two of them while laughing.
<br><br>
					A buff muscle macho man with the head of a horse.
<br><br>
					Your brother is that Superd race [Dead End] right?
<br><br>
					In an instant I moved in front of the two and cut off the horse faced man.
<br><br>
					“Shut up?! We’ll properly take an F or E rank job!”
<br><br>
					“Heyhey, you can’t do that. Aren’t I giving you advice here?”
<br><br>
					“What was that?”
<br><br>
					“Here, this job here. The lost pet search.”
<br><br>
					Rip, what was torn off was the job I was just looking at.
<br><br>
					“This is a higher rank because the town is a huge area to cover.”
<br><br>
					“Heyhey heyhey hey. Your brother is that Superd race [Dead End] right?”
<br><br>
					“So, what if that’s the case!”
<br><br>
					“Is the eye he has up here just for show? Even if the place is huge, with that eye it shouldn’t even take a day to complete, right?”
<br><br>
					Hm.
<br><br>
					I see now.
<br><br>
					Now that I think about it that certainly is the case.
<br><br>
					If it’s the type where we’re looking for a living thing, with Ruijerd here it will be a simple matter.
<br><br>
					For example if it’s a cat, if it’s him then.
<br><br>
					Rather, what does he mean by advice?
<br><br>
					Isn’t he just trying to stir us up because he thinks we’re fakes?
<br><br>
					“Shut up! Leave us alone!”
<br><br>
					Is what I said while rejecting him away, however with Ruijerd’s ability the lost pet search will go well.
<br><br>
					We should probably probably pull back for today.
<br><br>
					“Brother! Let’s go!”
<br><br>
					“Hm? Is it alright if we don’t take a job?”
<br><br>
					“It’s fine! If we were to take a job in this situation nothing good will come of it!”
<br><br>
					Either way, all I had planned for today was to show our faces and register anyways.
<br><br>
					Also, to check what kinds of jobs there are posted as well.
<br><br>
					Activity will seriously start from tomorrow on.
<br><br>
					“Let’s go.”
